Sparsity-certifying Graph Decompositions,"  We describe a new algorithm, the $(k,\ell)$-pebble game with colors, and use
it obtain a characterization of the family of $(k,\ell)$-sparse graphs and
algorithmic solutions to a family of problems concerning tree decompositions of
graphs. Special instances of sparse graphs appear in rigidity theory and have
received increased attention in recent years. In particular, our colored
pebbles generalize and strengthen the previous results of Lee and Streinu and
give a new proof of the Tutte-Nash-Williams characterization of arboricity. We
also present a new decomposition that certifies sparsity based on the
$(k,\ell)$-pebble game with colors. Our work also exposes connections between
pebble game algorithms and previous sparse graph algorithms by Gabow, Gabow and
Westermann and Hendrickson.

Strong Phase and $D^0-D^0bar$ mixing at BES-III,"  Most recently, both BaBar and Belle experiments found evidences of neutral
$D$ mixing. In this paper, we discuss the constraints on the strong phase
difference in $D^0 \to K\pi$ decay from the measurements of the mixing
parameters, $y^\prime$, $y_{CP}$ and $x$ at the $B$ factories. The sensitivity
of the measurement of the mixing parameter $y$ is estimated in BES-III
experiment at $\psi(3770)$ peak. We also make an estimate on the measurements
of the mixing rate $R_M$. Finally, the sensitivity of the strong phase
difference at BES-III are obtained by using data near the $D\bar{D}$ threshold
with CP tag technique at BES-III experiment.

Meta-Stable Brane Configuration of Product Gauge Groups,"  Starting from the N=1 SU(N_c) x SU(N_c') gauge theory with fundamental and
bifundamental flavors, we apply the Seiberg dual to the first gauge group and
obtain the N=1 dual gauge theory with dual matters including the gauge
singlets. By analyzing the F-term equations of the superpotential, we describe
the intersecting type IIA brane configuration for the meta-stable
nonsupersymmetric vacua of this gauge theory. By introducing an orientifold
6-plane, we generalize to the case for N=1 SU(N_c) x SO(N_c') gauge theory with
fundamental and bifundamental flavors. Finally, the N=1 SU(N_c) x Sp(N_c')
gauge theory with matters is also described very briefly.

Spinor dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates; Classical spin approach,"  Magnetic dipole-dipole interaction dominated Bose-Einstein condensates are
discussed under spinful situations. We treat the spin degrees of freedom as a
classical spin vector, approaching from large spin limit to obtain an effective
minimal Hamiltonian; a version extended from a non-linear sigma model. By
solving the Gross-Pitaevskii equation we find several novel spin textures where
the mass density and spin density are strongly coupled, depending upon trap
geometries due to the long-range and anisotropic natures of the dipole-dipole
interaction.

"Nonlinear Dynamics of the Phonon Stimulated Emission in Microwave
  Solid-State Resonator of the Nonautonomous Phaser Generator","  The microwave phonon stimulated emission (SE) has been experimentally and
numerically investigated in a nonautonomous microwave acoustic quantum
generator, called also microwave phonon laser or phaser (see previous works
arXiv:cond-mat/0303188 ; arXiv:cond-mat/0402640 ; arXiv:nlin.CG/0703050)
Phenomena of branching and long-time refractority (absence of the reaction on
the external pulses) for deterministic chaotic and regular processes of SE were
observed in experiments with various levels of electromagnetic pumping. At the
pumping level growth, the clearly depined increasing of the number of
coexisting SE states has been observed both in real physical experiments and in
computer simulations. This confirms the analytical estimations of the branching
density in the phase space. The nature of the refractority of SE pulses is
closely connected with the pointed branching and reflects the crises of strange
attractors, i.e. their collisions with unstable periodic components of the
higher branches of SE states in the nonautonomous microwave phonon laser.

Phase diagram of Gaussian-core nematics,"  We study a simple model of a nematic liquid crystal made of parallel
ellipsoidal particles interacting via a repulsive Gaussian law. After
identifying the relevant solid phases of the system through a careful
zero-temperature scrutiny of as many as eleven candidate crystal structures, we
determine the melting temperature for various pressure values, also with the
help of exact free energy calculations. Among the prominent features of this
model are pressure-driven reentrant melting and the stabilization of a columnar
phase for intermediate temperatures.

"High-spin to low-spin and orbital polarization transitions in
  multiorbital Mott systems","  We study the interplay of crystal field splitting and Hund coupling in a
two-orbital model which captures the essential physics of systems with two
electrons or holes in the e_g shell. We use single site dynamical mean field
theory with a recently developed impurity solver which is able to access strong
couplings and low temperatures. The fillings of the orbitals and the location
of phase boundaries are computed as a function of Coulomb repulsion, exchange
coupling and crystal field splitting. We find that the Hund coupling can drive
the system into a novel Mott insulating phase with vanishing orbital
susceptibility. Away from half-filling, the crystal field splitting can induce
an orbital selective Mott state.

Intelligent Life in Cosmology,"  I shall present three arguments for the proposition that intelligent life is
very rare in the universe. First, I shall summarize the consensus opinion of
the founders of the Modern Synthesis (Simpson, Dobzhanski, and Mayr) that the
evolution of intelligent life is exceedingly improbable. Second, I shall
develop the Fermi Paradox: if they existed they'd be here. Third, I shall show
that if intelligent life were too common, it would use up all available
resources and die out. But I shall show that the quantum mechanical principle
of unitarity (actually a form of teleology!) requires intelligent life to
survive to the end of time. Finally, I shall argue that, if the universe is
indeed accelerating, then survival to the end of time requires that intelligent
life, though rare, to have evolved several times in the visible universe. I
shall argue that the acceleration is a consequence of the excess of matter over
antimatter in the universe. I shall suggest experiments to test these claims.

"The Mass and Radius of the Unseen M-Dwarf Companion in the Single-Lined
  Eclipsing Binary HAT-TR-205-013","  We derive masses and radii for both components in the single-lined eclipsing
binary HAT-TR-205-013, which consists of a F7V primary and a late M-dwarf
secondary. The system's period is short, $P=2.230736 \pm 0.000010$ days, with
an orbit indistinguishable from circular, $e=0.012 \pm 0.021$. We demonstrate
generally that the surface gravity of the secondary star in a single-lined
binary undergoing total eclipses can be derived from characteristics of the
light curve and spectroscopic orbit. This constrains the secondary to a unique
line in the mass-radius diagram with $M/R^2$ = constant. For HAT-TR-205-013, we
assume the orbit has been tidally circularized, and that the primary's rotation
has been synchronized and aligned with the orbital axis. Our observed line
broadening, $V_{\rm rot} \sin i_{\rm rot} = 28.9 \pm 1.0$ \kms, gives a primary
radius of $R_{\rm A} = 1.28 \pm 0.04$ \rsun. Our light curve analysis leads to
the radius of the secondary, $R_{\rm B} = 0.167 \pm 0.006$ \rsun, and the
semimajor axis of the orbit, $a = 7.54 \pm 0.30 \rsun = 0.0351 \pm 0.0014$ AU.
Our single-lined spectroscopic orbit and the semimajor axis then yield the
individual masses, $M_{\rm B} = 0.124 \pm 0.010$ \msun and $M_{\rm A} = 1.04
\pm 0.13$ \msun. Our result for HAT-TR-205-013 B lies above the theoretical
mass-radius models from the Lyon group, consistent with results from
double-lined eclipsing binaries. The method we describe offers the opportunity
to study the very low end of the stellar mass-radius relation.

Coulomb excitation of unstable nuclei at intermediate energies,"  We investigate the Coulomb excitation of low-lying states of unstable nuclei
in intermediate energy collisions ($E_{lab}\sim10-500$ MeV/nucleon). It is
shown that the cross sections for the $E1$ and $E2$ transitions are larger at
lower energies, much less than 10 MeV/nucleon. Retardation effects and Coulomb
distortion are found to be both relevant for energies as low as 10 MeV/nucleon
and as high as 500 MeV/nucleon. Implications for studies at radioactive beam
facilities are discussed.

Intersection Bodies and Generalized Cosine Transforms,"  Intersection bodies represent a remarkable class of geometric objects
associated with sections of star bodies and invoking
  Radon transforms, generalized cosine transforms, and the relevant Fourier
analysis. The main focus of this article is interrelation between generalized
cosine transforms of different kinds in the context of their application to
investigation of a certain family of intersection bodies, which we call
$\lam$-intersection bodies. The latter include $k$-intersection bodies (in the
sense of A. Koldobsky) and unit balls of finite-dimensional subspaces of
$L_p$-spaces. In particular, we show that restrictions onto lower dimensional
subspaces of the spherical Radon transforms and the generalized cosine
transforms preserve their integral-geometric structure. We apply this result to
the study of sections of $\lam$-intersection bodies. New characterizations of
this class of bodies are obtained and examples are given. We also review some
known facts and give them new proofs.

On-line Viterbi Algorithm and Its Relationship to Random Walks,"  In this paper, we introduce the on-line Viterbi algorithm for decoding hidden
Markov models (HMMs) in much smaller than linear space. Our analysis on
two-state HMMs suggests that the expected maximum memory used to decode
sequence of length $n$ with $m$-state HMM can be as low as $\Theta(m\log n)$,
without a significant slow-down compared to the classical Viterbi algorithm.
Classical Viterbi algorithm requires $O(mn)$ space, which is impractical for
analysis of long DNA sequences (such as complete human genome chromosomes) and
for continuous data streams. We also experimentally demonstrate the performance
of the on-line Viterbi algorithm on a simple HMM for gene finding on both
simulated and real DNA sequences.

Experimental efforts in search of 76Ge Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay,"  Neutrinoless double beta decay is one of the most sensitive approaches in
non-accelerator particle physics to take us into a regime of physics beyond the
standard model. This article is a brief review of the experiments in search of
neutrinoless double beta decay from 76Ge. Following a brief introduction of the
process of double beta decay from 76Ge, the results of the very first
experiments IGEX and Heidelberg-Moscow which give indications of the existence
of possible neutrinoless double beta decay mode has been reviewed. Then ongoing
efforts to substantiate the early findings are presented and the Majorana
experiment as a future experimental approach which will allow a very detailed
study of the neutrinoless decay mode is discussed.

"Nilpotent symmetry invariance in the superfield formulation: the
  (non-)Abelian 1-form gauge theories","  We capture the off-shell as well as the on-shell nilpotent
Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) and anti-BRST symmetry invariance of the
Lagrangian densities of the four (3 + 1)-dimensional (4D) (non-)Abelian 1-form
gauge theories within the framework of the superfield formalism. In particular,
we provide the geometrical interpretations for (i) the above nilpotent symmetry
invariance, and (ii) the above Lagrangian densities, in the language of the
specific quantities defined in the domain of the above superfield formalism.
Some of the subtle points, connected with the 4D (non-)Abelian 1-form gauge
theories, are clarified within the framework of the above superfield formalism
where the 4D ordinary gauge theories are considered on the (4, 2)-dimensional
supermanifold parametrized by the four spacetime coordinates x^\mu (with \mu =
0, 1, 2, 3) and a pair of Grassmannian variables \theta and \bar\theta. One of
the key results of our present investigation is a great deal of simplification
in the geometrical understanding of the nilpotent (anti-)BRST symmetry
invariance.

Littlewood-Richardson polynomials,"  We introduce a family of rings of symmetric functions depending on an
infinite sequence of parameters. A distinguished basis of such a ring is
comprised by analogues of the Schur functions. The corresponding structure
coefficients are polynomials in the parameters which we call the
Littlewood-Richardson polynomials. We give a combinatorial rule for their
calculation by modifying an earlier result of B. Sagan and the author. The new
rule provides a formula for these polynomials which is manifestly positive in
the sense of W. Graham. We apply this formula for the calculation of the
product of equivariant Schubert classes on Grassmannians which implies a
stability property of the structure coefficients. The first manifestly positive
formula for such an expansion was given by A. Knutson and T. Tao by using
combinatorics of puzzles while the stability property was not apparent from
that formula. We also use the Littlewood-Richardson polynomials to describe the
multiplication rule in the algebra of the Casimir elements for the general
linear Lie algebra in the basis of the quantum immanants constructed by A.
Okounkov and G. Olshanski.

"Lagrangian quantum field theory in momentum picture. IV. Commutation
  relations for free fields","  Possible (algebraic) commutation relations in the Lagrangian quantum theory
of free (scalar, spinor and vector) fields are considered from mathematical
view-point. As sources of these relations are employed the Heisenberg
equations/relations for the dynamical variables and a specific condition for
uniqueness of the operators of the dynamical variables (with respect to some
class of Lagrangians). The paracommutation relations or some their
generalizations are pointed as the most general ones that entail the validity
of all Heisenberg equations. The simultaneous fulfillment of the Heisenberg
equations and the uniqueness requirement turn to be impossible. This problem is
solved via a redefinition of the dynamical variables, similar to the normal
ordering procedure and containing it as a special case. That implies
corresponding changes in the admissible commutation relations. The introduction
of the concept of the vacuum makes narrow the class of the possible commutation
relations; in particular, the mentioned redefinition of the dynamical variables
is reduced to normal ordering. As a last restriction on that class is imposed
the requirement for existing of an effective procedure for calculating vacuum
mean values. The standard bilinear commutation relations are pointed as the
only known ones that satisfy all of the mentioned conditions and do not
contradict to the existing data.

I-V characteristics of the vortex state in MgB2 thin films,"  The current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of various MgB2 films have been
studied at different magnetic fields parallel to c-axis. At fields \mu0H
between 0 and 5T, vortex liquid-glass transitions were found in the I-V
isotherms. Consistently, the I-V curves measured at different temperatures show
a scaling behavior in the framework of quasi-two-dimension (quasi-2D) vortex
glass theory. However, at \mu0 H >= 5T, a finite dissipation was observed down
to the lowest temperature here, T=1.7K, and the I-V isotherms did not scale in
terms of any known scaling law, of any dimensionality. We suggest that this may
be caused by a mixture of \sigma band vortices and \pi band quasiparticles.
Interestingly, the I-V curves at zero magnetic field can still be scaled
according to the quasi-2D vortex glass formalism, indicating an equivalent
effect of self-field due to persistent current and applied magnetic field.

Magnetic Fingerprints of sub-100 nm Fe Nanodots,"  Sub-100 nm nanomagnets not only are technologically important, but also
exhibit complex magnetization reversal behaviors as their dimensions are
comparable to typical magnetic domain wall widths. Here we capture magnetic
""fingerprints"" of 1 billion Fe nanodots as they undergo a single domain to
vortex state transition, using a first-order reversal curve (FORC) method. As
the nanodot size increases from 52 nm to 67 nm, the FORC diagrams reveal
striking differences, despite only subtle changes in their major hysteresis
loops. The 52 nm nanodots exhibit single domain behavior and the coercivity
distribution extracted from the FORC distribution agrees well with a
calculation based on the measured nanodot size distribution. The 58 and 67 nm
nanodots exhibit vortex states, where the nucleation and annihilation of the
vortices are manifested as butterfly-like features in the FORC distribution and
confirmed by micromagnetic simulations. Furthermore, the FORC method gives
quantitative measures of the magnetic phase fractions, and vortex nucleation
and annihilation fields.

An online repository of Swift/XRT light curves of GRBs,"  Context. Swift data are revolutionising our understanding of Gamma Ray
Bursts. Since bursts fade rapidly, it is desirable to create and disseminate
accurate light curves rapidly.
  Aims. To provide the community with an online repository of X-ray light
curves obtained with Swift. The light curves should be of the quality expected
of published data, but automatically created and updated so as to be
self-consistent and rapidly available. Methods. We have produced a suite of
programs which automatically generates Swift/XRT light curves of GRBs. Effects
of the damage to the CCD, automatic readout-mode switching and pile-up are
appropriately handled, and the data are binned with variable bin durations, as
necessary for a fading source.
  Results. The light curve repository website
(http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_curves) contains light curves, hardness ratios and
deep images for every GRB which Swift's XRT has observed. When new GRBs are
