Consistently, the I-V curves measured at different temperatures show\na scaling behavior in the framework of quasi-two-dimension (quasi-2D) vortex\nglass theory. However, at \\mu0 H >= 5T, a finite dissipation was observed down\nto the lowest temperature here, T=1.7K, and the I-V isotherms did not scale in\nterms of any known scaling law, of any dimensionality. We suggest that this may\nbe caused by a mixture of \\sigma band vortices and \\pi band quasiparticles.\nInterestingly, the I-V curves at zero magnetic field can still be scaled\naccording to the quasi-2D vortex glass formalism, indicating an equivalent\neffect of self-field due to persistent current and applied magnetic field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Apr 2007 14:01:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Oct 2007 03:07:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-09-08","authors_parsed":[["Yang","Huan",""],["Jia","Ying",""],["Shan","Lei",""],["Zhang","Yingzi",""],["Wen","Hai-Hu",""],["Zhuang","Chenggang",""],["Liu","Zikui",""],["Li","Qi",""],["Cui","Yi",""],["Xi","Xiaoxing",""]]},

As\nthe nanodot size increases from 52 nm to 67 nm, the FORC diagrams reveal\nstriking differences, despite only subtle changes in their major hysteresis\nloops. The 52 nm nanodots exhibit single domain behavior and the coercivity\ndistribution extracted from the FORC distribution agrees well with a\ncalculation based on the measured nanodot size distribution. The 58 and 67 nm\nnanodots exhibit vortex states, where the nucleation and annihilation of the\nvortices are manifested as butterfly-like features in the FORC distribution and\nconfirmed by micromagnetic simulations. Furthermore, the FORC method gives\nquantitative measures of the magnetic phase fractions, and vortex nucleation\nand annihilation fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Apr 2007 06:14:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23","authors_parsed":[["Dumas","Randy K.",""],["Li","Chang-Peng",""],["Roshchin","Igor V.",""],["Schuller","Ivan K.",""],["Liu","Kai",""]]},

We have produced a suite of\nprograms which automatically generates Swift/XRT light curves of GRBs.

The light curve repository website\n(http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_curves) contains light curves, hardness ratios and\ndeep images for every GRB which Swift's XRT has observed.
