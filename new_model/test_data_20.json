At the\npumping level growth, the clearly depined increasing of the number of\ncoexisting SE states has been observed both in real physical experiments and in\ncomputer simulations. This confirms the analytical estimations of the branching\ndensity in the phase space. The nature of the refractority of SE pulses is\nclosely connected with the pointed branching and reflects the crises of strange\nattractors, i.e. their collisions with unstable periodic components of the\nhigher branches of SE states in the nonautonomous microwave phonon laser.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Apr 2007 05:32:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-25","authors_parsed":[["Makovetskii","D.

Consistently, the I-V curves measured at different temperatures show\na scaling behavior in the framework of quasi-two-dimension (quasi-2D) vortex\nglass theory. However, at \\mu0 H >= 5T, a finite dissipation was observed down\nto the lowest temperature here, T=1.7K, and the I-V isotherms did not scale in\nterms of any known scaling law, of any dimensionality.

As\nthe nanodot size increases from 52 nm to 67 nm, the FORC diagrams reveal\nstriking differences, despite only subtle changes in their major hysteresis\nloops. The 52 nm nanodots exhibit single domain behavior and the coercivity\ndistribution extracted from the FORC distribution agrees well with a\ncalculation based on the measured nanodot size distribution. The 58 and 67 nm\nnanodots exhibit vortex states, where the nucleation and annihilation of the\nvortices are manifested as butterfly-like features in the FORC distribution and\nconfirmed by micromagnetic simulations.

We have produced a suite of\nprograms which automatically generates Swift/XRT light curves of GRBs.
